# Cryptocurrencies

## Purpose
  In order to complete an analysis of currently traded cryptocurrencies, this repository will preprocess the available data, reduce to 3 Principal Components using PCA, and cluster the cryptocurencies with K-Means. Finally, the clustered dataframe will be ploted in 3D using the plotly express module, and another scatter plot of the Total Coin Supply vs Total Coins Mined will be scaled and presented.
## Results
  3D Data Clustering:

## Summary
  Overall, the cryptocurrencies are grouped fairly tightly with a few outliers in each visualization. Additional steps will need to be performed to determine which of these qualities makes for a good cryptocurrency investment.
